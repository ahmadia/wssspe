# Gardens and Meadows in Sustainable Scientific Computing - [DRAFT for Submission](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/)

## Aron Ahmadia

With apologies to *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

## Introduction and Definitions

### Scientific Software Infrastructure:

Any scientific software or computing environment specifically designed to enable or accelerate scientific discovery.  "Infrastructure for innovation"

### Garden:

Any Scientific Software Infrastructure that possesses at least one of the following two attributes:

R1.  Access to the software is restricted by a non-OSI license.  
R2.  Access to the software is restricted to a particular hardware vendor.

Double points for both restrictions.

### Meadow:

Scientific Software Infrastructure uninhibited by either R1 or R2.

**GVW: right now, they're *all* effectively gardens because of lack of skills among scientists --- a meadow you can't get into is a garden as far as you're concerned.  Cf. Berlin's distinction between positive and negative liberty.**

## Some illustrating examples

### Numerical Computing Environments

#### Gardens

* MATLAB

#### Meadows

* Scientific Python Stack
* Traditional Programming Languages (C, C++, Fortran)
* Octave
* Julia

### Analytical Environments

#### Gardens

* Mathematica
* Magma

#### Meadows

* Sage

### Parallel Computing Interfaces

#### Gardens

* CUDA

#### Meadows

* MPI
* OpenMP
* OpenCL

### Debugging Environments

#### Gardens

* Totalview
* DDT

#### Meadows

* GDB

*Jed points to ParMETIS and TetGen as examples of walled gardens that are almost meadows.*

## Discussion

### The importance of the garden

#### Allows industry to participate in the acceleration of scientific innovation

### The limitations of the garden

#### Decreases the impact of research funding by stifling reuse
#### Decreases trust in algorithms and implementations
#### Discourages citizen science
#### Discourages automation and integration
