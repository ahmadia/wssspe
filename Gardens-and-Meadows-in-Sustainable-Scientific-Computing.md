# Gardens and Meadows in Sustainable Scientific Computing - [DRAFT for Submission](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/)

## Aron Ahmadia

## Introduction and Definitions

### Scientific Software Infrastructure:

Any scientific software or computing environment specifically designed to enable or accelerate scientific discovery.  "Infrastructure for innovation"

### Garden:

Any Scientific Software Infrastructure that possesses at least one of the following two attributes:

R1.  Access to the software is restricted by a non-OSI license.
R2.  Access to the software is restricted to a particular hardware vendor.

Double points for both restrictions.

### Meadow:

Scientific Software Infrastructure uninhibited by either R1 or R2.

## Some illustrating examples

### Numerical Computing Environments

#### Gardens

MATLAB

#### Meadows

Scientific Python Stack
Traditional Programming Languages (C, C++, Fortran)
Octave
Julia

### Analytical Environments

#### Gardens

Mathematica
Magma

#### Meadows

Sage

### Parallel Computing Interfaces

#### Gardens

CUDA

#### Meadows

MPI
OpenMP
OpenCL

*Jed points to ParMETIS and TetGen as examples of walled gardens that are almost meadows.*
